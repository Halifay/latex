abstract = {An entropy scaling based technique using the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory is described for predicting the viscosity of hydrocarbon mixtures and diesel fuels up to high temperatures and high pressures. The compounds found in diesel fuels or hydrocarbon mixtures are represented as a single pseudo-component. The model is not fit to viscosity data but is predictive up to high temperatures and pressures with input of only two calculated or measured mixture properties: the number averaged molecular weight and hydrogen to carbon ratio. Viscosity is predicted less accurately when the mixture contains high concentrations of iso-alkanes and cyclohexanes. However, it is shown that predictions for these mixtures are improved by fitting a third parameter to a single viscosity data point at a chosen reference state. For hydrocarbon mixtures, viscosity is predicted with average mean absolute percent deviations (MAPDs) of 12.2\% using the two-parameter model and 7.3\% using the three-parameter model from 293 to 353 K and up to 1000 bar. For two different diesel fuels, viscosity is predicted with an average MAPD of 21.4\% using the two-parameter model and 9.4\% using the three-parameter model from 323 to 423 K and up to 3500 bar.}

 abstract = {Two new techniques for measuring viscosities at high pressure have been implemented at the TERMOCAL laboratory in order to obtain accurate values of thermophysical properties such as viscosity, especially at high pressures. A vibrating-wire viscometer has been developed to accurately measure viscosities over the working ranges T=(283.15 to 423.15)K and p=(0.1 to 140)MPa. The setup of the equipment includes calibration with toluene and its validation with n-dodecane. A falling body viscometer able to measure viscosities at T=(253.15 to 523.15)K and p=(0.1 to 140)MPa is also presented in this work. Results of calibration with toluene and its verification with n-heptane and n-dodecane are reported. The detailed uncertainty budgets for both techniques are included in this work. Moreover, the paper studies the compatibility of the results obtained using both techniques according to their corresponding uncertainties in order to obtain reliable data. New viscosity measurements of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane have been performed and included in the paper.},

 abstract = {Phase equilibria data for complex systems (more than three components or two phases, high pressures, complex fluids…) are needed to develop thermodynamic models capable of correlating and predicting their behaviour. Along these lines, systems composed of water, oil and surfactant exhibit an interesting conduct. In this work, the (liquid+liquid) equilibria of a ternary system comprising water, n-dodecane and a surfactant ionic liquid, trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, have been determined at temperatures (298.15 or 348.15)K and atmospheric pressure. Winsor type III systems have been found without the need of adding any co-surfactant. The stability of the triphasic system with temperature has been tested. Some physical properties (density, viscosity and interfacial tension) for phases involved have been also determined. As expected, a minor surfactant character has been found for this ionic liquid rather than for the homologous with the chloride anion.},

The excess molar volume VE, has been calculated from the experimental measurements. These results were fitted to Redlich and Kister polynomial equation to estimate the binary interaction parameters. The viscosity data were correlated with equations of Grunberg and Nissan, and McAllister. The refractive indices data were used to calculate the specific refractivity R12, and also correlated with Lorentz–Lorenz equation. While the excess molar volumes of {anisole+hexane} are negative, and {anisole+heptane} are sigmoidal S-shaped, the remaining binary mixtures are positive. The effects of n-alkanes chain length as well as the temperature on the excess molar volume have been studied. The calculated values have been qualitatively used to explain the intermolecular interaction between the mixing components.},

A two-capillary viscometer was designed and proved to be applicable to the viscosity measurements in a mini-tube. The standard uncertainty of dynamic viscosity measurements is identified as (2.22–5.28)\% (coverage factor k=2). N-heptane, n-octane and their binary mixture were tested respectively in the calibration experiments of the viscometer. Results showed that the measured maximum relative deviations of all substances were all within 2\% and the average absolute deviations were within 0.72\%. Finally viscosities of a kerosene kind hydrocarbon fuel were measured using the two-capillary viscometer at temperature from (303.2 to 513.2)K and supercritical pressures of (3.00 and 4.00)MPa.},

The apparatus is based on the rolling-ball principle and consists of a computer-controlled stepper motor that rotates a high-pressure cell that is equipped with a sapphire window, a movable piston, and a position-sensing device. Design of the high-pressure cell was made such that compositions could be determined by mass. The viscosity was determined by sensing the speed of a rolling ball, and the density was determined by sensing the position of the piston with a linear-variable differential transformer. Bubble-point pressures were measured with the synthetic method. The viscosity and density of octane and decane were measured, and the average deviations of these properties compared with reliable literature values were 1.1 \% and 0.15 \%, respectively. The viscosity and density of CO2 + tetrahydrofuran system were measured at a temperature of 60 °C, a pressure of 10.2 MPa, and CO2 mole fractions up to 0.3. Bubble-point pressures for the CO2 + tetrahydrofuran system were in good agreement with literature data.},

A triphasic region surrounded by two biphasic regions has been found. Due to the surfactant character of the ionic liquid, the system can be classified as Winsor Type III. The liquid–liquid and liquid–liquid–liquid equilibrium data of the corresponding immiscible regions were obtained. Focusing the work on surfactant flooding applications, the interfacial tensions between equilibrium phases of the binary and ternary systems were determined in presence or absence of salt. A comparison with other ionic liquids previously tested has been done on the basis of the position of the apex of the three-phase tie-triangle and the measured interfacial tensions. Other trihexyltetradecylphosphonium ionic liquids, with chloride or bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate anions, showed more promising results. However, the knowledge of the phase diagram is of interest for processes that involve the co-existence of water, oil and ionic liquid, as triphasic catalysis or microemulsions applications.},

The influence of structure of ether on the strength of molecular interaction has been analysed through the calculation of formation constants of these complexes computed using Kannappan equation.

 abstract = {The density and viscosity of binary mixtures of D2EHPA + organic solvent were measured in the temperature range of 303.15–333.15 K and 0.1 MPa. The common organic solvents, having different dielectric constants, namely kerosene (2.0), n-heptane (1.92), chlorobenzene (5.62) and 1-octanol (10.3) were employed in this work. The experimental density and viscosity data were validated employing Nasrifar-Moshfeghian (NM) equation of state (EOS) and Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation: data correlations proved to be a good fit according to the RAD values in the range of 0.01–2.00\%. Further, the excess molar volume and viscosity deviation were calculated in order to investigate the nature of the solute-solvent binary mixtures. For all binary mixtures, the excess molar volume and viscosity deviations have negative deviations from ideality over the temperature range. The strongest interaction of D2EHPA extractant occurred in kerosene solvent affected by its large hydrophobic molar volume. In addition, other thermodynamic properties of mixtures such as apparent molar volume, thermal expansion coefficients, excess Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy of activation of viscous flow were calculated.},

 abstract = {Density and viscosity measurements are reported for {x1n-heptane+(1−x1)n-octane} mixtures at x1=(0.2808, 0.5427, 0.7906). The measurements of density and viscosity were made with a constant-volume piezometer immersed in a precision liquid thermostat and a capillary flow technique, respectively. Measurements were made at pressures up to 10MPa. The range of temperature was (293 to 557)K for the density measurements and (298 to 473)K for the viscosity measurements. The total uncertainty of density, viscosity, pressure, temperature, and composition measurements was estimated to be less than 0.06\%, 1.6\%, 0.05\%, 15mK, and 0.02\%, respectively. The effect of temperature, pressure, and concentration on density and viscosity of the binary {x1n-heptane+(1−x1)n-octane} mixtures was studied. The measured values of density and viscosity for the pure components and mixtures were compared with those generated by reference equations and prediction techniques for the mixtures. The excess molar volumes VmE and the viscosity deviations Δη were derived using the measured values of density and viscosity for the mixtures and pure components. The viscosity data have been interpreted in terms of the Grunberg–Nissan equation for binary mixtures. The temperature dependence of the Grunberg–Nissan constant was studied using the present viscosity data. The molar excess Gibbs energy of activation for flow ΔEa was also calculated from our experimental viscosity data for the (n-heptane+n-octane) mixtures.},

Excess molar volumes VE, viscosity deviations Δη, and excess Gibbs free energy of activation ΔG∗E, were calculated there from and were correlated by Redlich–Kister type function in terms of mole fractions. For mixtures of toluene with n-pentane and n-hexane the VE is negative and for the remaining systems is positive. The Δη values are negative for all the studied mixtures. The ΔG∗E values shows the positive values for the binary mixtures with n-decane, whereas the negative values have been observed for all the remaining binary mixtures. From the results, the excess thermal expansivities at constant pressure αE, is also estimated. The Prigogine–Flory–Patterson (PFP) theory and its applicability in predicting VE is tested. The results obtained for viscosity of binary mixtures were used to test the semi-empirical relations of Grunberg and Nissan, Tamura and Kurata, Hind et al., Katti and Chaudhri, McAllister, Heric, Kendall, and Monroe. The experimental on the constituted binaries are analyzed to discus the nature and strength of intermolecular interactions in these mixtures.},

 abstract = {Addition of molecular solvents, dodecane and water, to the hydrophobic phosphonium ionic liquid (IL) tetradecyltrihexylphosphonium bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate decreases its density and viscosity significantly. These changes have been studied in the temperature interval between 15 and 60°C and explained in terms of structural changes. Dependences of density and viscosity on the composition of binary and ternary systems are strongly nonlinear. Excess molar volumes and thermal expansion coefficients have been estimated for dry and water saturated solvents with IL. Strong H-bonding in water saturated solvents has been concluded from large negative excess molar volumes and strong temperature dependence of the density in water saturated solvents. VFT, Litovitz and Arrhenius models were tested for the correlation of temperature dependence of pure IL viscosity, showing that IL is a typical strong liquid. Deviations of the viscosity of the solvents to the ideal mixture viscosity based on the Eyring’s theory of absolute rates were evaluated. In dynamic light scattering measurements, two different types of aggregates have been identified in the dry and water saturated solvents, with the mean size above 300 and 2nm, respectively. High content of water of up to 8 molecules per ion pair of IL points to the existence of reverse micelles in the water containing solvents with hydrophobic IL.},

At 0.1MPa, the viscosity has been measured with a classical capillary viscometer (Ubbelohde) with an uncertainty of ±1\%. A total of 208 experimental data points are reported. The viscosity behavior of this binary system is interpreted as the results of changes in the free volume, and the breaking or weakening of hydrogen bonds. The excess activation energy for viscous flow of the mixtures is negative with a maximum absolute value of 0.3kJmol−1, indicating a very weakly interacting system. The data of this binary system as well as those recently measured for ethanol+toluene have been used to study the performance of some viscosity models with a physical and theoretical background. The evaluated models are based on the hard-sphere scheme, the concepts of the free-volume and the friction theory, and a model derived from molecular dynamics. In addition to these models, the simple compositional models by Grunberg–Nissan and Katti–Chaudhri have also been applied. Overall a satisfactory representation of the viscosity of these two binary ethanol+C7 hydrocarbon systems is found for the different models within the considered T, P range taking into account their simplicity.},

Here experimental data of the dynamic viscosity, η, at 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure, over the complete composition range are presented. As noted, the second compound of all mixtures belong to the same aromatic family, with a benzene ring having one ethyl chain or two methyl chains placed at different sites of the benzene ring. So, the molar mass for all four second compounds is exactly the same. Thus, these measurements will provide information about the influence of the methyl chain positions on the viscosity when it is mixed with hexane. From the measured values of the dynamic viscosity, dynamic viscosity deviations of the binary mixtures are determined and the viscosity deviations are compared with other deviation results for similar mixtures, and among the different binary mixtures.},
